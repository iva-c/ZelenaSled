    "## Compute Average Noise Level per Path Based on Noise Data from Intersected Polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "This script calculates the average **noise level** for each path based on the **noise polygons** it intersects. Each noise polygon contains noise level data in dbs, which was measured in Ljubljana.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "- **Path-Based Noise Analysis**: The script evaluates the noise levels along different paths by averaging the noise values of the polygons they pass through.\n",
    "- **Polygon Intersection**: Uses **shapely** to efficiently compute intersections between paths and noise polygons to calculate noise levels.\n",
    "- **Flexible Input Format**: Takes in two GeoJSON files â€” one with noise polygon data (containing noise levels) and another with a set of paths represented by their geographic coordinates and lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Noise Data (GeoJSON)**:\n",
    "  - Contains geographic polygons with noise levels, representing areas of varying noise intensity, downloaded from https://data.noise-planet.org/noisecapture/.\n",
    "- **Paths Data (GeoJSON)**:\n",
    "  - A set of 25 paths with defined geometric lines and associated attributes like path length in meters to be assessed and compared based on noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- For each path, the script returns the **average noise level** based on the noise values of all polygons it intersects, providing insights into noise exposure along the route.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "- **Environmental Noise Data**  \n",
    "  - **Source**: [Data nise-planet] (https://data.noise-planet.org/noisecapture/)\n",
    "  - **Format**: Noise data is pre-processed into GeoJSON format, with each polygon representing a specific noise zone and its corresponding level.\n"
